Ignore the 1 series. They were swept with a maths function on.

The 2 series were swept on the SVA1075 after calibration using the same F603FE cal kit. Data for this kit is built into the SVA.
The Kirby Female (no nut) standards were swept too.
The SVA had been turned on for about 24 hours prior - very stable.
100 averages were used for all sweeps - however the SVA doesn't average when doing a cal.
